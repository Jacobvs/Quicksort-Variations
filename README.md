# Description
This project creates numerous datasets and performs analysis of various quicksort algorithm implementations
Algorithms (from Sedgewick book):
- Cutoff to Insertion Sort (p. 296)
- Median-of-three partitioning -- sample a[lo], a[hi] and a[mid] and choose middle as pivot
- Three-way partitioning (p. 299)

Datasets:
- N uniformly random doubles -- use StdRandom.double() for this [a sedgewick class]
- N strings from the English dictionary. 
- N integers from StdRandom.uniform(N/k) for k in 2,3,4, ... 16. The invocation to uniform(p) returns a uniformly distributed random integer from 0 up to p-1.

 These three data sets approximate (1) true randomness; (2) arbitrarily structured data; (3) data with lots of duplicate keys.
